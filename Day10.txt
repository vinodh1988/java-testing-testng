     List
        - List is linear collection of elements.
        - List is generic in nature.
        - It allows duplicate elements.
        - It maintains the insertion order of elements.
        - It allows null elements.
        - It is index based. (accessed by index)
        - Insertions and deletions are allowed at any position.
        
        List is an interface in Java that extends the Collection interface.
        List provides methods to manipulate the elements in a sequential manner.
        
        the implementations of the List interface include:
        - ArrayList
        - LinkedList
        
    
    
     Set
       
           - Set is a collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
            - It does not maintain the insertion order of elements (unordered).
            - It allows null elements, but only one null element is allowed.
            - It is not index based (elements cannot be accessed by index).
            
            Set is an interface in Java that extends the Collection interface.
            The implementations of the Set interface include:
            - HashSet
            - LinkedHashSet
            - TreeSet
            
           HashSet
           -------
           - HashSet is a collection that uses a hash table for storage.
           - It allows null elements(only once).
           - It does not maintain the order of elements.
           - It does not allow duplicate elements.
           
           TreeSet
           --------
           - TreeSet is a collection that uses a red-black tree for storage.
           - It does not allow null elements.
           - It maintains the natural ordering of elements or a custom comparator(sorted).
           - It does not allow duplicate elements.
           
    how compare to method logic works in TreeSet?
      when two objects are equal according to the compareTo method,you
      return 0.
      when the first object is less than the second object, you return a negative integer.
      when the first object is greater than the second object, you return a positive integer.
     Map
     -----
      Map is a collection that stores key-value pairs.
      - It does not allow duplicate keys.
      - It allows duplicate values.
      - It does not maintain the insertion order of elements (unordered).
      - It allows null keys and values(null key only once).
      - It is not index based (elements cannot be accessed by index).	
      Implementations of the Map interface include:
      - HashMap
      - TreeMap
      
      HashMap
      ---------
      - HashMap is a collection that uses a hash table for storage.
      - It allows null keys and values (only one null key).
      - It does not maintain the order of elements.
      - It does not allow duplicate keys.
      - It allows duplicate values.
     
     TreeMap
     --------
         - TreeMap is a collection that uses a red-black tree for storage.
        - It does not allow null keys.
        - It maintains the natural ordering of keys or a custom comparator(sorted).
        - It does not allow duplicate keys.
        - It allows duplicate values.
        
        How compareTo method logic works in TreeMap?
            when two objects are equal according to the compareTo method,you
            return 0.
            when the first object is less than the second object, you return a negative integer.
            when the first object is greater than the second object, you return a positive integer.
